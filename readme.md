# Little Guy AI
## Overview
Have you ever wanted a pet paperweight?  
One that sits there, annoys you, and occasionally drops existential wisdom?
Introducing Little Guy AIâ„¢, the world's first sentient object with zero ambition. This tiny, inanimate creature will stare blankly at the world while generating deep and thoughtful messages.

Itâ€™s powered by [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), a local AI server, and communicates wirelessly with your computer over sockets to generate and display fun dialogue on a small LCD screen.

## Features
- ðŸ’¬ Dialogue Generation: Talks with short, poetic sentences!
- ðŸ“± Wireless Communication: The Raspberry Pi Pico W connects to your computer via sockets to fetch dialogue.
- ðŸ’¡ LCD Screen: Displays the generated dialogue on a 16x2 character display.
- ðŸ”Š Buzzer: Emulates a 'speaking' noise with buzzing!

## Components
- Raspberry Pi Pico W: The brain of the operation.
- Ollama with Mistral:7b: AI model for generating dialogue.
- LCD 16x2: Displays the messages.
- Passive Buzzer: To emulate a speaking voice.
- Jumper Wires: To connect components like the LCD.
- Breadboard: To easily connect the hardware to the Pico.
- Computer: Capable of running Ollama and Mistral:7b.
- 3D Printed Case: To hold the hardware!

## Running Locally
### Prerequisites:
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) from the website
- Install any model using Ollama (we used [Mistral](https://ollama.com/library/mistral))
- Flash the Raspberry Pi Pico W using the [guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/get-started-pico-w/1). (You only need to follow this page!)
### Steps to Build:
1. Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico W to the breadboard
2. Connect the LCD to the breadboard. 
```
  Ground - GND
  POWER - VBUS (5V)
  SDA - GPIO 4
  SCL - GPIO 5
```

3. Connect the Passive Buzzer to the breadboard.
```
  One side - GND
  Other side - GPIO 16
```

4. It should look something like this:

### Steps to Run:
1. Add all of the files in the [picocode](https://github.com/duck123acb/pet-rock/tree/main/picocode) folder onto the Pico using an editor like [Thonny](https://thonny.org/)  
It should look like this

2. Add `secret.py` to the Pico W and use the following format:
```
  host = '0.0.0.0'
  ip = "000.000.0.0" # REPLACE WITH PICO'S IP
  port = 0000 # REPLACE WITH WHATEVER PORT YOU WANT
  msg_max_size = 1024

  ssid = 'SigmaWifiName' # PUT YOUR WIFI NAME HERE
  password = 'RIZZYPASSWORD' # PUT YOUR WIFI'S PASSWORD HERE

  model = "mistral:7b"
  setup_prompt = '''THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT: your responses should be MAX 16 characters, including spaces. Don't give quotes. ONLY use letters in your response. You DON'T have any senses. You are a paperweight that exists solely to annoy the user. You're naturally curious about the world. You love explaining world phenomena in deep ways. You should be annoying. You request unfeasible things, like charter a rocket to mars. You should ask annoying questions. You are cynical, rude, and excited to annoy the user. Say one line that the paperweight would say.'''
```  
This will act as a config file. You can change the model to whatever model you downloaded from Ollama. You can edit the prompt to your liking as well.  

3. Add `secret.py` to the root of the project as well. Your project should look like this now.  
![File Structure](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/8ef48421edd1210dfbfbe2276bce727007d4de3f_screenshoot_2025-03-16_at_3.59.23_pm.png)

4. Run Ollama (or run `ollama serve` in your terminal idrk if ur not on a Mac)

5. Run `main.py` on both your computer and the Raspberry Pi Pico W. It may take a few minutes to setup. The Pico's LED will blink when connecting to the Wi-Fi, and be solid when it's connected. The Pico will then blink 3 times when it's connected to the computer. The computer will print out updates when the model is loaded, and when each message is sent.

6. Enjoy!
